Take-Home Coding Assignment

During your interview process, you will have one or more live coding exercises. The following is
a take-home question that is representative of the difficulty of questions you might face
throughout the interview process. Please complete the problem on your own. While you may
be able to find a solution to the problem online, that won’t benefit you in the live rounds.

Problem:
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
s and t only consist of lowercase English letters.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different work or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once.
Example 1: Input: s = “anagram”, t = “nagaram”; Output: true
Example 2: Input: s = “rat”, t = “car”; Output: false
Implement a function called IsAnagram. Consider readability, time complexity, and unit tests.
